// What is a Synchronous System?
// In a synchronous system, tasks are completed one after another.

// Think of this as if you have just one hand to
// accomplish 10 tasks. So, you have to complete one task at a time.

// What is an Asynchronous System?
//     In this system, tasks are completed independently.
//     Here, imagine that for 10 tasks, you have 10 hands. So, each hand can do each task independently and at the same time.
//
//     Take a look at the GIF ðŸ‘‡ â€“ you can see that each image loads at the same time.

// Synchronous system, three images are in the same lane. One can't overtake the other. The race is finished one by one. If image number 2 stops, the following image stops.

// Synchronous Code Example

console.log("i ")
console.log("eat ")
console.log("ice cream")



// Asynchronous example
// Let's say it takes two seconds to eat
// some ice cream. Now, let's test out an asynchronous system.
// Write the below code in JavaScript.

console.log("i ")
setTimeout(()=>{
    console.log("eat ")

}, 3000)
console.log("ice cream")
